# Introduction to Exploring AI Possibilities

## Introduction

This course aims to help decision makers and leaders understand artificial intelligence (AI) at a strategic level. Not everyone will write an AI algorithm, and that is okay! Our rapidly evolving AI landscape means that we need executives and managers who know the essential information to make informed decisions and use AI for good. This course specifically focuses on the essentials of what AI is and what it makes possible, to better harmonize expectations and reality in the workplace.

## Motivation

This course will help you with your understanding of AI, helping you make strategic decision and cultivate a business environment that embraces the benefits of AI, while understanding its limitations and risks.

## Target Audience

This course is targeted toward industry and non-profit leaders and decision makers.
