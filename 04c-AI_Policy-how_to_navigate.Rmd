# Why do I need an AI policy?

Big technological shifts always trigger a period of explosive growth where the technology and what's possible changes incredibly quickly. We're in that stage right now with AI systems. Everyone is curious, scared, and interested in AI. Chat GPT accumulated 100 million users in 2 months, which is faster than many other major apps.

```

The future workforce is already regularly using AI and bans will not be practical nor effective. Over 40% of university students use ChatGPT for coursework. Thirty-nine percent of prospective students say they wouldn’t consider going to a college that banned Chat GPT and other LLMs.

Each month regularly brings new opportunities and surprises, many of which we can’t anticipate and require organizations to adapt quickly. Everyone is using AI, but no one really knows how to use it properly. The rapid changes are making new capabilities feasible while also bringing to light new and unique concerns. However, adopting this new technology at the right time and in a way that minimizes mistakes and bad outcomes can make great things happen for your organization. It’s a bit like catching the tail of a rocket ship just being launched, but catching it in a way that doesn’t burn you to a crisp.

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}

``` 

New technology adoption is scary, and while caution is advisable, all-out bans are not practical. Thirty or so years ago, we had a similar technological shift with the advent of the Internet. At the time, using the Internet for common, everyday tasks was a big deal, and there was fear about how it would change how we work. Now, we have accepted the Internet as a way of life and it’s a normal experience to look things up on Google or shop on the internet. In 30 years, AI systems will be the same.

Employees will use AI and this will make them more effective. Thoughtful AI policies can balance your employees' use with safety and security measures.

# Elements of an AI policy

A good AI policy should be a living document that evolves as your company adapts to AI use.

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
ottrpal::include_slide("https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1C7TykleNSbPkaiJBJeCbxYte5sWWZ8J3uixt9RMyiWg/edit#slide=id.g2a0db34665a_0_6")
```

As AI tools advance, so should the policy surrounding them. It should provide clear guidance and frameworks for developing, deploying, and using AI systems in a responsible and ethical manner. Having a policy in place that is well communicated can provide an extra level of security for your organization and employees.

When writing an AI policy, you might consider whether asynchronous collaboration versus synchronous collaboration is right for you. With an asynchronous approach, people write their individual sections of a document by a deadline, after which the full policy is polished and edited. With a synchronous approach, an organization might convene a set of meetings with experts over a length or time to work on the document together. There are benefits and drawbacks to both approaches, and you will know which best fits your organization's needs.

In general, a policy might have sections devoted to the following topics:

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}

```

1. _Purpose and Scope_. In this section, you might define what your organization's goals and plans for AI use, as well as what types of AI systems the policy will cover. This section might also contain definitions of specific terms, like what your organization considers AI or generative AI. A purpose and scope section can ensure everyone is aligned and avoid ambiguity.

1. _Values and Principles_. This section states how your organization's core values and principles will guide your use and development of AI tools. Some possible principles might be fairness, transparency, accountability, safety, or privacy.

1. _Governance and Oversight_. You may want to establish a clear governance strategy for overseeing AI initiatives. This includes the roles of those involved in decision-making, as well as their responsibilities.

1. _Data Management and Privacy_. This section outlines data governance practices that ensure data quality, security, and responsible use in AI systems. You should make sure your guidelines are compliant with relevant data privacy regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and other industry-specific regulations.

1. _Fairness and Non-discrimination_. In this section, you can lay out how you might monitor and audit AI systems for possible bias. This section can also include guidelines for developing or deploying AI in ways to avoid perpetuating or exacerbating bias or discrimination based on protected characteristics.

1. _Risk Management, Safety, and Oversight_. A section like this might lay out robust testing procedures to monitor, identify, and mitigate potential risks associated with AI systems, including security vulnerabilities, safety hazards, and unintended consequences. It can also identify ways to ensure oversight and accountability for AI systems, ensuring humans remain ultimately responsible for AI-driven decisions.

1. _Education and Training_. This section describes how your organization will provide training and education programs on AI systems on responsible AI development, deployment, and use. You can also detail how these training modules will be created and what topics are necessary for different groups of employees.

1. _Feedback and Review_. In this section, you can establish a mechanism for regularly reviewing and updating the AI policy as technology and best practices evolve. You may also want to implement procedures for employees to give feedback about AI issues or concerns within your organization.

# Building an AI advisory team

**AI Policy is a teamwork endeavor**. Experts from many different fields need to come together to bring the latest updates. As someone in charge of making sure your organization is using AI wisely and properly, staying up-to-date on the laws, regulations, and computational resources is vital. It's also something that is really difficult to do alone. Building a team of individuals that can help you confidently navigate the evolving landscape should be one of your top priorities as a leader.
