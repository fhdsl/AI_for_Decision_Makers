  prompt: Which of the following best describes the training data?

  shuffleOptions: true
  options:
    - answer: Data used to initially train the machine learning model
      isCorrect: true
    - answer: Data used to fine-tune and improve the machine learning model
      isCorrect: false
    - answer: Data used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning model
      isCorrect: false
    - answer: Data that is better determine how the model might work in other contexts
      isCorrect: false

- typeName: multipleChoice
  prompt: Why is it important to have independent training and testing datasets?

  shuffleOptions: true
  options:
    - answer: To avoid overfitting the model to the training data
      isCorrect: false
    - answer: To more accurately evaluate model performance
      isCorrect: false
    - answer: To fine-tune the model using a validation set
      isCorrect: false
    - answer: Both a and b
      isCorrect: true

- typeName: multipleChoice
  prompt: According to the passage, what is the preferable way to partition data for machine learning?

  shuffleOptions: true
  options:
    - answer: Use all data for training only
      isCorrect: false
    - answer: Use some data for training and the rest for testing
      isCorrect: false
    - answer: Use some data for training, some for validation, and the rest for testing
      isCorrect: true
    - answer: There is no preferred way, any partitioning is acceptable
