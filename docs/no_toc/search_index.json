We think understanding AI is essential for executives. It helps today’s leaders make strategic decisions, drive innovation, enhance efficiency, and foster a culture that embraces the transformative power of these technologies. Specifically, AI proficiency can help leaders in the following ways: Strategic Decision-Making: Understanding AI and machine learning equips leaders to make informed decisions about integrating these technologies into business strategies, setting their teams up for success when working with AI. Risk Mitigation: Familiarity with AI helps leaders assess risks associated with implementing these technologies, ensuring that ethical considerations, data privacy, and potential biases are addressed to mitigate negative consequences. Leaders can also implement more informed policies for their teams. Efficiency and Experience: Leaders can explore how AI applications enhance operational efficiency, automate repetitive tasks, and assist employee learning and development, leading to increased productivity and breakthroughs. These improvements can also improve the experience of users or customers your organization serves. Resource Allocation: AI resources can be expensive, including in terms of computing resources, subscription services, and/or personnel time. Understanding AI enables leaders to allocate resources effectively, whether in building in-house AI capabilities, partnering with external experts, or investing in AI-driven solutions that align with the organization’s mission. Innovation Leadership: Leaders can foster a culture of innovation by understanding the transformative potential of AI. Awareness and knowledge can also enable leaders to identify opportunities for innovation, helping their teams match the rapidly evolving technological landscape. Data-Driven Decision Culture: Leaders can promote a data-driven decision-making culture within their organizations, using AI insights to inform strategic planning, understand their teams better, and improve other key business functions. Communication with Tech Teams: Executives and managers benefit from understanding AI event if they aren’t building tech, as it helps them effectively communicate with their technical teams. This can mean more effective collaboration and improved alignment between teams or departments. 2.2 Target Audience The course is intended for … 2.3 Curriculum The course covers… "],["introduction-to-ai-possibilities.html", "Chapter 3 Introduction to AI Possibilities 3.1 Motivation 3.2 Target Audience 3.3 Curriculum", " Chapter 3 Introduction to AI Possibilities 3.1 Motivation 3.2 Target Audience The course is intended for … 3.3 Curriculum The course covers… "],["what-is-ai.html", "Chapter 4 What Is AI 4.1 Introduction 4.2 Examples 4.3 Machines Can Learn Like Us 4.4 The Data Explosion 4.5 What Is and Is Not AI", " Chapter 4 What Is AI 4.1 Introduction 4.1.1 Motivation This course will help you with your understanding of AI, helping you make strategic decision and cultivate a business environment that embraces the benefits of AI, while understanding its limitations and risks. 4.1.2 Target Audience This course is targeted toward industry and non-profit leaders and decision makers. 4.1.3 Curriculum Summary In this course, we’ll learn about what Artificial intelligence is, and what it isn’t. We’ll also learn the basics of how it works, learn about different types of AI, and set some ground rules for minimizing the harms and maximizing the benefits of AI. 4.2 Examples [[[[[Start off with actual uses/case studies/examples]]]]]] 4.3 Machines Can Learn Like Us Human beings are powerhouses when it comes to pattern recognition and processing (Mattson 2014). We are constantly observing the world around us, collecting data to learn and make decisions. For example, we might notice a pattern between the amount of traffic on roads in a city, and the time of day. Much like the human brain, machine learning detects patterns within data. Machine learning is at the heart of artificial intelligence, allowing computers to learn and make predictions. In more complex machine learning, computers make millions of calculations, mastering the mapping of inputs (observations) to outputs (predictions). This process mirrors how humans learn through experience. Machine Learning: Machine learning is a way for computers to learn from examples and improve their performance over time, resembling how humans learn from experience. A machine learning system refines its understanding by continuously updating its parameters based on the feedback received from the provided data. For example, our system might be guessing traffic by time of day, but also judging its accuracy while accounting for other factors, such as whether or not it was a work day, if some workers are on holiday, or how many people live in the city. The rise of machine learning has been propelled by our ability to collect vast amounts of data and sophisticated types of AI and computing power which we will learn about later. 4.4 The Data Explosion Let’s revisit the traffic example. If you drive once at a specific time of day and observe the traffic around you, you have one data point. You can do this a bunch of times and collect more data. Historically, this is the way data has been collected, and you could manage that data in an Excel Spreadsheet. However, as computer storage and data collection methods have become more sophisticated, our ability to collect data has exploded in scale. It’s not hard to imagine that using traffic cameras, dashcams, and car sensors could collect a lot more information than any one person. Data comes in many shapes and forms. Think about how much text information is freely available on the internet! Using that as input data, artificial intelligence systems can look for patterns of words that typically go together. For example, you’re much more likely to see the phrase “cancer is a disease” than “cancer is a computer program”. We can see this in action using the AI ChatGPT below. 4.5 What Is and Is Not AI "],["video-what-is-ai-and-what-it-is-not.html", "Chapter 5 VIDEO What Is AI and What It Is Not", " Chapter 5 VIDEO What Is AI and What It Is Not "],["video-how-ai-works.html", "Chapter 6 VIDEO How AI Works", " Chapter 6 VIDEO How AI Works "],["how-ai-works.html", "Chapter 7 How AI Works", " Chapter 7 How AI Works "],["video-different-types-of-ai.html", "Chapter 8 VIDEO Different Types of AI", " Chapter 8 VIDEO Different Types of AI "],["types-of-ai.html", "Chapter 9 Types of AI", " Chapter 9 Types of AI How they work..
