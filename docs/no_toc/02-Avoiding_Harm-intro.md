# (PART\*) Avoiding AI Harm {-}



# Introduction to Avoiding AI Harm

This course aims to help you recognize some of the potential consequences of using or developing AI tools.

Some of this content was adapted from our course on [AI for Efficient Programming](https://hutchdatascience.org/AI_for_Efficient_Programming/ethics-of-using-ai.html). If you intend to use AI for writing code, we recommend that you review this content for a deeper dive into ethics specifically for writing code with generative AI. 

## Motivation

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and in particular, generative AI, has raised a number of ethical concerns. We will highlight several current concerns, however please be aware that this is a dynamic field and the possible implications of this technology is continuing to develop. It is critical that we as a society continue to evaluate and predict what the consequences of the use of AI will be, so that we can mitigate harmful effects.
