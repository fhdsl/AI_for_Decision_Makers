## Motivation

There are a ever increasing number of options, strategies and solutions for integrating AI solutions into a project. It can feel overwhelming to understand what these options entail let alone understand how to decide what solution best fits a use case.

In this course we aim to give individuals the basic info they need to make basic plans for integrating AI tools into their project.

## Target Audience  

The course is intended for individuals who have an AI related project in mind or think that they might need to incorporate AI into their project. They are likely the leader who is guiding others in an AI related project and not necessarily the person who will write code or carry out the technical aspects of the project.

## Curriculum  

**What this course covers:**

- What are the practical aspects of AI that need to be understood before endeavoring on an AI project?
- What makes an AI model good?
- How do you determine what kinds of custom AI solutions your project needs if any?
- What aspects of your resources and your project should you consider when evaluating AI strategies?
- What would better suite your needs an "out of the box" AI product or building an AI model solution "from scratch"?
- Examples of currently existing AI solutions that may suit an individual's AI needs.

**What this course does NOT cover:**

- This is NOT a comprehensive survey of the AI tools and products in existence. Even if it was comprehensive at this time, there are new tools and developments constantly arriving. We merely give examples of solutions that show a *possible* AI solution. There may be competitors or similar solutions out there that would even better fit a project's needs.
- This does NOT cover in depth aspects of algorithms, statistics or mathematics behind AI algorithms -- these are numerous and not always necessary to understand in fine detail for making decisions about projects.
- This does NOT cover how to complete or write code for an AI project. This is not a tutorial for building an AI tool. Instead we merely give strategies you could employ but we do not give details on how you might employ them. There are too many ways that AI tools may be built -- this is outside the scope of this course.
