# Consent and AI

Much of the world is developing data privacy regulations, as many individuals value their right to better control how others can collect and store data about them (@chaaya_privacy_2021).

While data collection concerns have been increasing up for years, AI systems present new challenges (@pearce_beware_2021; @tucker_privacy_2018):

- **Accountability** - it is more difficult to determine who is accountable at times when separate parties may collect vs use data
- **Data reuse** - data collected for one purpose is getting reused for other purposes that may dramatically change over time. For example data collected on food purchases for food companies could get reused by insurance companies to determine health risk based on dietary behavior.
- **Data spillover** - accidental data collection due to collection for a different purpose, for example a photo of someone with other individuals in the background
- **Trickier Consent** - Consent to allow data collection is trickier as it is less clear that users understand the potential risks (@andreotta_ai_2022)
- **Easier Data Collection/Translation** - AI makes it really easy to collect and record new forms of data about individuals such as transcriptions of meetings. This is making it easier for people to record people without their consent and poses privacy risks (@elefant_can_2023).

Consent is especially a concern for healthcare research, where potential participants need to understand the potential risks of participation. Yet, the risks of data collection continue to evolve.
